## Not Good Enough
![Not Good Enough.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/Not Good Enough.jpg)

Mamool woke up in a warehouse, which was long and narrow and stretched so far in the distance that he could not see the other end but could see the metal sides on either side. The farther end was shrouded in darkness, and the floor up to the darkness was lit by lights arranged in lines of three along the ceiling that flickered constantly and buzzed with a low humming sound. As he was trying to figure out how he reached there, the lights from the farther end of the warehouse started to switch off in batches of three and the darkness was creeping towards him till it stopped with just the three lights above him still switched on. Those lights turned off too and he was thrown into complete darkness. His heart began racing as the fear of what unknown entity was lying in wake for him in the darkness started creeping upon him, just as the darkness had creeped up on him. But to his relief the set of three lights ahead of him turned on and he could see the warehouse floor in the small pool of light and he automatically started walking towards it. ‘Walk towards the light’ he had heard people say all his life and he did just that; it was as if the lights were coaxing him to do their bidding. 

He reached the pool of light, and as soon as he stepped under the lights the next set of lights turned on and he kept on following the series of lights that turned on ahead of him as the light he was standing under turned off, so that with each step he was walking away from the darkness and into the light. After walking for a few minutes, he could sense that the other end of the warehouse was getting near as he could make out a faint blinking red light getting closer to him. He was hoping it was the light above a door which would help him get out of this hellish nightmare that he had found himself in. He started walking faster towards the red blinking light and now the lights from the ceiling were trying to catch up with him as he kept walking ahead in the darkness. The final set of lights at the end of the warehouse turned on and he could finally see that the red blinking light was not attached to a door but instead was on a curious looking vending machine that was attached to the wall. 

The vending machine had one slit near the bottom, a computer screen in the middle and on the top the red blinking light he had seen from the distance and which he now realised was a camera, and on either side of it were two robotic arms. The screen in the middle had two large words on them - PRESS HERE, so he did, as one does when a screen tells you to do something, without question or thought about what would come after. As soon as he tapped the button on the screen, a square piece of cardboard slid out from the top slit on the vending machine and kept hanging out, half out and half in, while on the screen a message popped up - 

“ATTEMPT 1: CUT THE SHEET INTO A CIRCLE AND HAND IT TO THE ARMS. 
YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES.” 

Mamool pulled out the sheet that was hanging out and looked behind him. All the lights were turned off and he stared into the darkness wondering if he should just make a run for it, when a metal cage dropped down from the ceiling around him with a loud clang which scared the shit out of him. After the initial shock, he rushed to the cage and tried to push the metal cage but it did not budge, holding the thick solid metal bars of the cage made him realise that lifting it was out of the question. It dawned on him that he was now trapped in the pool of light in a cage with the vending machine and no way out. He was hoping that if he finished the task from the vending machine the cage might go up and he would be able to escape, so he turned back towards the vending machine and was wondering how was he supposed to cut the square cardboard sheet into a circle with his hands when he noticed a box cutter on the floor next to the machine attached to its foot with a short metal chain. He walked towards it and picked up the cutter but the chain was not long enough for him to stand up so he sat down cross legged in front of the vending machine with the cardboard in one hand and the cutter in the other. 

A loud siren started blaring from the machine, he put his hands on his ears and looked up, he noticed that the screen had turned red and a counter on the screen was showing him that he had one minute left. He scrambled and started cutting the sheet into a crude circle, his heart was pounding and could not focus with the siren continuing to blare right in his face from somewhere inside the machine. He had not worked with a cutter in years and all the cuts were turning out jagged and the final product looked more like the outlines of Australia than a circle. He looked up and saw the screen was showing - TIME UP. He handed the sheet to the outstretched robotic arms which had moved in a swift smooth motion. The arms started examining the sheet by moving the tips of their fingers along the edge of the sheet, after covering the whole sheet’s edge the robotic arms held up the sheet in front of Mamool’s face and snapped them into two pieces and threw the pieces towards him, he ducked just in time and the pieces flew over his head, crashed against the bars of the cage and fell to the floor. The siren went off again and the screen showed a new message - “NOT GOOD ENOUGH”. The message blinked in sync with the siren and came off and on again for thirty seconds and then everything went silent. 

Mamool was reeling from the shock of the sudden attack from the robotic arms and the loud siren that followed, he could not move and was transfixed by the message on the screen, which made him feel small almost like the way he felt as a child. In the silence after the screen had turned off, he realised that he was breathing heavily and beads of sweat had started forming on his forehead and his upper lips. He could hear the buzzing sounds from ceiling lights again, it was like the lights were sniggering together and looking down at him mockingly. He had followed the stupid lights to get here and they knew what was in wait for him, and they were enjoying watching him suffer. Just then, a new message came up on the screen -

“ATTEMPT 2: CUT THE SHEET INTO A CIRCLE AND HAND IT TO THE ARMS. 
YOU HAVE 8 MINUTES.”

A new square sheet had slid out of the slot. He pulled out the sheet and without wasting any time got to work. He started to think that he could cut out the four corners of the square and create a circle that way instead of cutting a free hand circle. He started from the middle of one edge of the square and started to cut out an arc that would remove the corner and meet the right edge of the square. When he started to cut into the sheet he realised that it was taking more effort to cut the sheet and noticed that the sheet was almost twice as thick as the previous sheet he had worked with. The diabolical machine had doubled the thickness of the sheet and reduced the time by two minutes. He muttered a few curses in a whisper because he did not know if the machine could hear him, he knew he was certainly being watched by the camera. He started cutting more carefully this time to avoid any jagged lines. He worked his way through three corners and the sheet was looking like a three quarters circle with a pointy end. He started working on the fourth corner and suddenly the siren went off to warn him that he had only a minute left, the siren made him flinch slightly and his hand turned a little and he cut a little too inside the arc. He tried to salvage the situation by retracing the blade back and started to cut along the intended arc, but a small piece of the sheet broke off where he had cut a little too deep. The siren stopped and the robotic arms came to life and were outstretched in front of him ready for judgement. He handed over the sheet and the robotic arms examined the sheet and as soon as it reached the nick in the fourth quarter of the circle, the robotic arms held up the sheet in front of his face and snapped it into two pieces and threw them towards him. He tried to duck like the last time but the robotic arms had aimed the pieces slightly lower this time and one of the pieces hit him in the eye and the second one hit him on his cheek. The pieces were thrown with such force that his eyelid had been cut open and blood started flowing from it, his cheek had a cut and he was bleeding from it as well. The siren was blaring again and the screen had the message - “NOT GOOD ENOUGH”. Looking at the message with his one remaining eye made him angry at the injustice that was being inflicted on him. He got up and in blinding rage attacked the vending machine, but as he took a step towards the machine to attack it, the robotic arm on the left came in fast and hit him right in the kidney before he realised what had happened and with such force that he fell back clutching his side and momentarily forgetting the pain in his eye which was overpowered by the pain in his side. He lay on the floor finding it difficult to breathe when a new message appeared on the screen - “ATTACK ON THE SYSTEM WILL BE PENALISED”. 

Mamool did not know what that would entail or how much more he could take, he was in pain and could not see with one eye. He tore off the sleeve of his shirt and tied it like a bandage around his head and covered his eye to staunch the bleeding as best as he could. His side continued to hurt and he thought that he might have a few fractured ribs because it hurt everytime he inhaled. Just then, a new message came up on the screen -

“ATTEMPT 3: CUT THE SHEET INTO A CIRCLE AND HAND IT TO THE ARMS. 
YOU HAVE 2 MINUTES.”

A new square sheet slid out of the slot, this was visibly thicker than the previous two sheets, almost a centimetre in thickness. Mamool pulled the sheet out and felt the thickness and tried to cut with the blade but could barely make a dent in the sheet. He had tears in his eyes and hit the sheet on his own head in despair. He knew he would not be able to cut the sheet into a circle with the small blade he had with him. The countdown on the screen reached down to one minute and the siren started blaring again. He just stared at it unflinchingly, knowing that he would not be able to finish the task in the remaining time no matter how hard he tried. The countdown reached zero and the robotic arms were outstretched for judgement, but Mamool did not hand over the sheet. The robotic arm boxed him in the side of his head and then he handed over the sheet to the robotic arms. The robotic arms traced the edge of the sheet and noticed the sharp edges of the square sheet unchanged and brought the sheet in front of his face and snapped it into two pieces, with the same ease as it had the first sheet, and threw the pieces towards him. He had his hands up in front of his face in anticipation of the assault. The pieces hit him directly on the bones of his forearms and he heard a slight crack from both his hands. He doubled over from the pain and laid down on the ground. The siren was blaring again and the message on the screen said - “NOT GOOD ENOUGH”. The message blinked on the screen for thirty seconds and everything went silent. The red blinking light on the machine turned off as well, there would not be any other attempts, there would be no escape. Mamool could hear the buzzing of the lights again, he just lay down on his back now and stared at the lights, his body in pain. He closed his remaining eye for a second and the buzzing of the lights stopped as well, he opened his eye in a panic but he could not see anything, he was in complete darkness, with only the faint afterglow in the ceiling where the three fluorescent lights had been glowing. 

Mamool realised he was still clutching the box cutter in his hand. He cut a long slit on his left arm with the blade, starting from his wrist to the middle of his forearm, warm blood started flowing out from it as his heart kept pumping blood, it was good enough at that. He was lying in the pool of his own blood, his thoughts started to become bleary and he slowly started to lose consciousness as the blood continued to flow out of the many cuts. Suddenly he noticed there was a light in the ceiling, coming as if from the end of a long tunnel. He walked towards the light.
